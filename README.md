Welcome to CurseCoin.

This is a short smart contract that allows you to curse eth accounts.
You just have to pay the small curse cost of 20 finney (0.02 ether or ~6USD).

You can check if your account is cursed at [am-i-cursed.com](http://am-i-cursed.com).
If your account is cursed, you can also pay the curse cost to lift your curse. You're welcome.

Deets can be found in contracts/CurseCoin.sol.
